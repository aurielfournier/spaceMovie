## Space Movie color palettes
The colors used in this package were all found using publically available sources, many of them from LucasArts themselves. For example:

- [Rebels](http://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-rebels-costume-color-guide-for-padawans-twileks-and-more)
- [Imperials](http://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-rebels-costume-color-guide-for-imperials)

Kartik Ram's [Wes Anderson](https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson) color palette inspired me to create this package and I followed his implementation for consistency.
